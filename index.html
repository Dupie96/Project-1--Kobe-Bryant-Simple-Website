    <p>Starting Off, You HAVE to Include Kobe First NBA debut which was on
        <strong>November 3.1996</strong> where he played 6 minutes and he had 0 points, 1 rebound, 1 block, and 1 steal that night. (Kobe got drafted first round 13th pick by the
        <em>Charolotte Hornets</em> which made him the first player to get drafted out of High School; Of course Kobe did not want to play for the Hornets so they traded kobe to the <em>Los Angeles Lakers</em> for
        <em>Vlade Divac</em> that same night

    <p>The Summer of 1999, Coach Phil Jackson became the Head Coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and went on to coach both Shaq and Kobe and went onto becoming the best 2 player combo in NBA history (My own opinion). During the <strong>Lakers first NBA
            Title win in 2000</strong>, The Lakers played the <em>Sacramento Kings </em> in the first round(Lakers won the series 4-2 in game 6 out of 7),Played the <em>Phoenix Suns</em> in the Conference Semifinals (Lakers won the series 4-1 in game
        5 out of 7),Played the
        <em>Portland Trailblazers</em> in the Western Conference Finals (Lakers won the seires 4-3 in game 7). Lakers played the <em>Indiana Pacers</em> in the NBA finals(Lakers won the series 4-2 in 6 games out of 7), Kobe got to finally feel what it
        is like to be a World Champion. During the
        <strong>Lakers Second NBA Title win in 2001</strong>, the Lakers played the <em>Portland Trailblazers</em> first round (Lakers Swept the Blazers 4-0 in game 4 out of 7); In the Conference Semifinals the Lakers played the Sacramento Kings (Lakers
        Swept the Kings 4-0 in game 4 out of 7); In the Westen Conference Finals, the Lakers played San Antonio Spurs (Lakers Swept the Spurs 4-0 in game 4 out of 7). The Los Angeles Lakers made the NBA finals for the second year in a row and went on
        to play the
        <em>Philadephia 76ers</em> (the Lakers did beat the Sixers 4-1 in game 5 out of 7).During the <strong>Lakers third Title Win in 2002</strong>, The Lakers played the <em>Portland Trailblazers</em> for the third time in a row but only in the First
        Round (Lakers went on sweeping the Trailblazers 4-0 in 4 games out of 7); The Lakers went on playing the
        <em>San Antonio Spurs</em> for the second year in a row in the Conference Semifinals (Lakers went on beating the Spurs 4-1 in 5 games out of 7); The Lakers advance to the Western Conference Finals where they played the <em>Sacramento
            Kings
            </em> for the 3rd time in a row (Lakers went on beating the Kings 4-3 in game 7). The Lakers reached the NBA finals a third time in a row (something that NBA legend Magic Johnson was not able to accomplish); Lakers went on to play the <em>New
            Jersey Nets</em> (Lakers swept the Nets 4-0) </p>

    </h3>
    <P>On January 22, 2006 against the Toronto Raptops, Kobe delieverd one of the best scoring performance that no one saw coming which he dropped 81 points and he is in 2nd place with the most points in a NBA game in NBA history behind
        <em>Wilt Chamberlerlain</em> who is #1 with 100 points in a NBA game (Still blows my mind how he dropped 100 points in one game). That night Kobe shot 28 out of 46 (28 made shots from 46 attempts), Shot 7 out of 13 from 3 point range (7 three
        pointers made from 13 shots), and went 18 out of 20 free throws made(He also recorded 6 rebounds, 3 steals). The Lakers went on beating the Toronoto Raptors 122-104. This game showed everyone how legendary Kobe was in his prime of his career</P>

    <P>The Lakers opener had Kobe dressed on purple and gold, but his relationship with the franchise (owner and executives) was pretty bad and his future was uncertain. Trade rumors (Bulls, Mavericks, Knicks) ended with the performance of Andrew Bynum and
        the arrival of Pau Gasol to make the Lakers a title candidate. The Lakers were the best team in the West with a 57-25 record, Kobe was NBA's second scorer and won his first Season MVP award. Kobe and the rest of the the team played really good
        in the playoffs but were embarrased by Boston in the NBA Finals.That season he averaged 28.4 Points, 6.3 Rebounds, 5.4 Assists, and 1.85 Steals. During the Playoffs, Kobe averaged 30.1 Points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.6 Assists and 1.67 Steals.</P>

    <strong>2009 NBA Title Run</strong>
    <P>During the
        <stong>2008-2009 NBA season</stong>, the Lakers were the Best Team in the Western Conference with a 65-17 record and reached the NBA finals a 2nd year in a row having to beat
        <em> Utah Jazz</em> in the first round(4-1), <em>Houston Rockets</em> in the Western Conference SemiFinals(4-3), and the
        <em>Denver Nuggets</em> in the Western Conference Finals(4-2). During the finals, the Lakers went on playing the
        <em>Orlando Magic</em> and went on beatting them 4-1 in Game 5. Kobe won his 4th ring</P>

    <strong>2010 NBA Title Run</strong>
    <p>One of my favorite Kobe Bryant memories; During the 2009-2010 season Kobe Bryant did injury is finger on his Shooting hand (Probably the worst feeling when you have to shoot the ball and your fingers hurt). Without injured Pau Gasol in the first 11
        games, Kobe scored at least 40 points four times, becoming only the third player in NBA history with 100 games of 40 or more points. (Chamberlain and Jordan are the other two) He also surpassed Allen Iverson, Patrick Ewing, Jerry West, Reggie
        Miller and Alex English to climb to the 12th spot in the NBA's all-time scoring list. By leaving West behind, Kobe became the Lakers all-time scoring leader. Multiple injuries made him rest 4 of the last 5 games of the season trying to get ready
        for the Playoffs. In the postseason Kobe led his team to another championship, his 5th, averaging 29.2 points 6 rebounds and 5.5 assists and won his second Finals MVP. During the Playoffs, the Lakers played <em>Oklahoma City Thunder</em> in the
        first round, beating them 4-2 in game 6, Went on to the Western Conference SemiFinals and played the
        <em>Utah Jazz</em> and completing the Sweep in 4 games (4-0), Went on playing the <em>Phoenix Suns</em> beating the 4-2 in game 6. Lakers reached the NBA finals for a third time in a row but they ended up playing the
        <em>Boston Celtics</em> where the lakers went on winning the 2010 NBA Finals and kobe successfully captured his 5th ring and getting their revenge on the Celtics from 2008.</p>
